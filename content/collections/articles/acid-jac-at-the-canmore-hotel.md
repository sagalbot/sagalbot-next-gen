I braved the cold out in Canmore this weekend to shoot Acid JAC at the Canmore Hotel, and ride Sunshine the next day. I'll have lot's of clips to put up... The lighting at The Canmore Hotel is incredible. Amazing sound too. Too bad I couldn't quite capture the sound off my internal mic. Going to need to invest in an external mic for the DSLR. This clip was run through Magic Bullet Quick Looks to give it the look it has. I'm sort of up in the air with it but figured I'd try it out.
