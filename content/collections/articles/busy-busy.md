Man, have I ever been busy. I kind of figured that summer would hit, assignments would be out of the picture and I'd have a whole lot of free time. Turns out it's quite the opposite. My last blog/news entry was some time in May, and I figured it's time I added something to the blog.

<a href="http://www.acidjac.com">AcidJAC.com</a> is now live! I've still got some work to do, but it's looking pretty solid. The site uses a great plugin; <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/events-calendar-pro-wordpress-premium-plugin/109301">Events Calendar Premium</a>, that allows the band to manage shows directly from the wordpress panel. They can add descriptions, start times, google maps, and lots more. Definitely worth taking a look at. The plugin is completely customizable so you can integrate it into any custom theme. I did have a few issues, but they were quickly addressed and fixed by the developers. 

I'd love to hear some feedback regarding the Acid JAC website!
