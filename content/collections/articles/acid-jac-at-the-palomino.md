Acid JAC played a killer show at the Palomino in Calgary on May 29. The sound out of this place is really impressive. These guys are taking off, with the first EP now on sale! I managed to fill up a 4 GB card shooting these guys on Friday night. Lots of photo ops as these guys put on a pretty exciting show.

Acid JAC is going to be playing at The Distillery two nights this coming week, Wednesday at 9, and Thursday at 10. Be sure to stop by for an awesome show! Grab your copy of the EP Tattoos and Tweed Amps while you're at it!

<strong>*EDIT*
Acid JAC will also be playing at the Calgary Arrata Opera House on Saturday June 5 as part of OldschoolFest. This is one you don't want to miss. $10 at the door!</strong>
