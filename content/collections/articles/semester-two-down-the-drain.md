Semester two is finally coming to a close here at SAIT. All of our major projects are completed, and we have exams next week, all of which should be a walk in the park. With the onset of summer, I'll finally have time to get started on my portfolio site at pluseleven.ca. I own the domain, but as of right now, there is nothing there, so I'm not going to bother making that a link. 

One of the projects that I saw from my peers today stood out. Fully hilarious. Check it out at <a href="http://vimeo.com/11173320">Vimeo.</a>
