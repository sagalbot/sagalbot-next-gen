I took a one week mountain bike adventure down in Colorado. Left the house at 4am Sunday May 16, arrived in Grand Junction Colorado at noon, on the trails by 3. Let me start by saying that this trip will forever change the standard by which I measure trails. Fruita is home to an extensive network of some of the most technical, exposed, and flowy trails I have ever ridden. You can find anything from super technical rock strewn trails in the Kokapelli area, to incredibly buff flat out trails at the Book Cliffs, as well as your slickrock fix at the Tabagouche area. 

We spent 5 days riding in Fruita, I would have been more than happy to spend 10. The riding there just doesn't get old. I'd have no problem riding trails like "Moore Fun" and "Mack Ridge" a hundred times. On the sixth day of the trip we drove out to Moab, the more popular mountain bike mecca. I only had two chances to ride there, so we shuttled to the top of upper porcupine singletrack (UPS), an hour long shuttle that leads to 27km of amazing riding. You descend over 1500 ft of total elevation and climb 400. Let me tell ya, I like that kind of climb to descent ratio. The next day we rode slickrock, which is just amazing. It's not slick. It's awesome. Pretty well feels like you are riding on sandpaper, capable of climbing any steep and stopping on a dime on a near death downhill. 

I have more than 40GB of bike-mounted HD footage from the trip. I'll soon be doing some voiceovers and some post production work with that footage. I should have an edit out by September. For now, here's some photos from the trip.
