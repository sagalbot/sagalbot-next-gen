Well it's that time of year again. I'm back to SAIT for my second and final year of New Media Production and Design. Now that I'm back here, I'll actually have much more time to spend developing sagalbot.com. I've learned a lot over the course of the summer, including much more advanced techniques within wordpress. The theme coding on this site is pretty archaic and not very dynamic. I've got a fresh redesign that's been sitting on the backburner for a few months now that should be ready to go within the next few weeks. Focusing less on flashy graphics and more on readability and updatability. Stay tuned!
