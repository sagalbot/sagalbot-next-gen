In May (2016) I raced my first enduro on the North Vancouver stop of the BC Enduro Series. Good times were had and I was super stoked to snag 7th place in U29 men, and 1st place on stage 2 - 7th secret on Mt Fromme. Thanks to <a href="http://www.pinkbike.com/u/srobarts/">Scott Robarts</a> for the great shot!
