Today marks 60 days since I went over the bars and ended up with a concussion. I never thought recovery would take anywhere near this long, but I guess that's just the nature of brain injuries.

Today is a great day though, because for the first time, it's been about three days now I've had any notable symptoms. I'm back on the bikes, bouldering, writing code - and loving every minute of it. I don't want to jinx it, but I thinkÂ very soon I won't have to think about recovery any more.

Can't wait.
