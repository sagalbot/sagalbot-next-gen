While doing my best to find some inspiration for an assignment I’m working on, I was browsing through some of my older photos in bridge. By older, I mean a couple months ago. I did a lot of shooting this summer and got very comfortable with my camera. I was glancing over one of my first sets from a very early season ride on Reclaimer in Canmore. This shot really stuck out, and although it didn’t originally make the cut, I think it’s the best of the shoot.
