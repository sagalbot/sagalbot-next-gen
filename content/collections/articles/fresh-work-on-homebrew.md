Brett, Taco and I went out for a rip out in Squamish on the search for some prime dirt. We ended up finding amazing looking new features on Homebrew that had been built in the last two weeks.

We had<a title="Squamish Winter Shredit" href="http://sagalbot.com/bikes/squamish-winter-shredit/"> ridden Pnuts a few weeks earlierÂ </a>and figured we'd try again. Turns out it was covered under about 3 feet of fresh snow. Instead, we rode Cakewalk to Full Nelson, traversed back across the mountain and explored near Homebrew. Everything in these pictures (<em>with the exception of one stepdown</em>) was built in just a few weeks. Squamish trail builders work fast! They had planks left out and weren't quite ready to hit, but it looks unreal.[gallery type="rectangular" ids="857,856,855,854,852,851,850,848,853,849,847"]
