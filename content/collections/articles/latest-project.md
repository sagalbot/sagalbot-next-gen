I've been doing lots of promotional work for a local Calgary band, <a href="http://www.acidjac.com">Acid JAC</a>. They have an upcoming CD release at Radiopark in Calgary on May 20. If you like genuine rock and roll, you should go. It's $10 cover and great drink and food specials.

I am nearly finished their <a href="http://www.acidjac.com/promo.html">promotional package</a>, and figured I would share it here, as there is some nifty jQuery going on there. <a href="http://www.acidjac.com/promo.html">Take a look.</a>

Let me know what you think!
