Here are a few of my favourite shots of the architecture around Berlin from my recent Euro trip in December '13.

Like all the shots from <a title="Euro Trip Tag" href="http://www.sagalbot.com/tag/euro-trip/">#eurotrip</a>, these were shot on my Canon G12. This trip really made me miss my DSLR and 28mm prime lens. Probably time to pick up a new Canon soon.
