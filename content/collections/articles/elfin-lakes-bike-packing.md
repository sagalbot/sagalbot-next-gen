	<li>Freeze dried food packs are the way to go. We brought a whole bunch of pre-cooked stuff and a bottle of wine. Next time we'll leave the bottle at home and empty the wine into an easier to carry container.</li>
	<li>Packing in water sucks - everyone there had water filters. We carried in 10L of water for the two of us. This was a lot of extra weight and we would've been much better off picking up a filtration system and packing only what we needed to get ourselves to the water source.</li>
	<li>Compression sacks are key. Our two sleeping bags took up almost my entire pack. That could've been avoided with a couple good compression sacks.</li>
	<li>Doing tables with a full pack is actually more fun.</li>

The descent the next morning was a good time, and we were thankful we put in the extra effort to ride up rather than hike.
