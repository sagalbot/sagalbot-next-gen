For those of you that don't know, sagalbot.com was the solution to one of my second semester assignments. It was the first website that I built from the ground up, and more specifically the first Wordpress theme I have built. Over the course of this summer, I spent most of my time contracting for <a href="http://www.swd.ca/">SWD</a>, slicing PSD's and writing the necessary php to create custom Wordpress themes. My progress started slow and eventually I was creating four tier accordion menus, multi-themed sites and more.

One of my first assignments coming back into school was to critique the website that I had designed back in April 2010. My biggest complaint was readability. For a new media blog, it sure was damn hard to navigate and read in general. I picked white text on black backgrounds, hard-coded navigation menus and a difficult to update blog structure. This critique inspired my new theme! I opened photoshop at 6:00pm this evening, and it's now 12:00am and I'm putting it live.

I still have some fixing to do here and there, but <strong>I hope you like it</strong>.
