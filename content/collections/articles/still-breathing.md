<p>2.5 weeks ago I was hit by a car while riding my bike. I can't remember a thing from that day, but I know from the police report that the vehicle that hit me sent me flying through the air, and my body landed 20m (65ft) from where the vehicle came to a stop. I managed to survive this catapult with fractures to my skull, 2 vertebrae, a rib and my pelvis. When I arrived in the ER, I had a collapsed lung, a dislocated hip, torn rotator cuff, a concussion, and what would develop into probably the biggest bruise / hematoma you've ever seen. I was only able to remember a few minutes before my memory would lapse.</p>

<p><br>Fast forward 2.5 weeks and I'm walking around our apartment with a single crutch. Every day has highs and lows, but I feel incredibly lucky to be alive. Any number of things could have gone just slightly different and I wouldn't be here to talk about it. This has left me with an incredible clarity to maximize every single moment. I have a long way left to go, and I'm excited to see where this path takes me.</p>
