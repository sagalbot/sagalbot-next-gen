<a href="http://www.owenconti.com">Owen Conti</a> and I have been working like crazy this week to film, edit and color correct our latest project, a full length music video for <a href="http://www.acidjac.com">Acid JAC</a>. Going into the project, we really didn't want to create a sort of "cookie cutter" typical music video. We had plans for a story going on along with the jamming footage. After realizing that we had one day to shoot all the footage, and a week to edit, a cookie cutter video was all we had time for. There were a few issues we can address for our next video project, but we learned a ton about shooting proper flat footage and color correcting that footage in post.

Regardless, we are super happy with how it turned out. Check it out.
