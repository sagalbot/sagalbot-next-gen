On June 17, 2016, I set out on a solo Friday night ride. Upon crossing the second narrows, I went through the usual contemplation between Fromme or Seymour. Having spent countless hours pedalling up Good Sir Martin this year, it was time to show Fromme some love. I decided to save myself some pain and park in the lot instead of at Coleman, and do a warm up on Floppy Bunny to make up for the calories I would've burned coming up from Coleman.

Floppy was running perfect. Hero dirt, new woodwork - perfect conditions to send it. After getting nice and loose on Floppy, I hunkered down for the climb up to 7th Secret. Still feeling guilty for parking in the lot, I soon took a sharp right into the woods for the masochistic delight that is the Wardens Climb. With my heart rate through the roof at the top of Wardens, my guilt was rightfully subdued, and I continued up the climb to 7th.

Nearing the trailhead to 7th, images of Wade Simmons tearing up Bookwus aboard his Rocky flooded my mind. In my short 4 years of riding the shore, I hadn't yet knocked it one off the list, so I decided to change up my go-to 7th lap and give Bookwus a rip.

Loamy, rooty, steep, and rocky - Bookwus is a classic shore trail that checks nearly all the boxes. I remember taking a cliff bar break half way through, and thinking to myself just how awesome this sport is. I linked up with 7th, and continued to flow into Leppard and Kirkford.

I figured nothing could cap this classic shore ride better than a lap on Ladies Only. Pedalling back up Mountain Highway once more,
